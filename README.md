When I'm cleaning up
--------
1. Fix element binding - use $(this.el) instead of $("#something")
2. Use templating as often as possible
3. Check view/model responsibilites are correct
4. Image/link to soundcloud
5. Global soundcloud client id
6. " and ' use
7. Initialize elements properly, don't just make them as a string and then refer to them with #thing
8. Put event bindings on correct classes
  a) change the updateTrackNumber event for #launchpad
