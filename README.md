Notes
--------

consistency for event names and functions
pass squareModel to trackDetails instead of maintaining duplicate model
show time for position slider
is the device always 0? See if you can refer to a device by it's name
make more consts, especially when it's referenced multiple places

for future: use listen function instead of on because it's managed by backbone and prevents memory leaks
