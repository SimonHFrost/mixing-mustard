When I'm cleaning up
--------
1. Use templating as often as possible
2. Check view/model responsibilites are correct
3. Image/link to soundcloud
4. Global soundcloud client id
5. Put event bindings on correct classes
  a) change the updateTrackNumber event for #launchpad
6. check property and method naming consistency
7. get rid of trackSet property on trackDetailsModel
8. pass launchpad element to event trigger method
