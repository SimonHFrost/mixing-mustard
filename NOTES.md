TODO
====

* consistency for event names and functions
* pass squareModel to trackDetails instead of maintaining duplicate model
* show time for position slider
* is the device always 0? See if you can refer to a device by it's name
* make more const, especially when it's referenced multiple places
* speed initial load by making midi initialization load async
* select first square on initialization

In the future: use listen() instead of on() because it's managed by backbone and prevents memory leaks
